- cleaned up the code of this pre-made website index page using HTML symantic tags instead of div tags.
- cleaned up css file by combining redundant entries and changing others to coincide with the fixed symantic tags.
- included comments on changes that were made.
- removed some unneeded code and commented out others, for my own understanding.
